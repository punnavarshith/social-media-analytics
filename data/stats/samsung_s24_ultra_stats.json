      "text": "**Samsung's Software Updates: A Silent Killer for Performance?**\n\nSamsung has long been known for its premium hardware, but what if I told you their software updates are intentionally designed to slow down your device? Over the years, many users like me have suspected that major software updates gradually reduce battery life, camera performance, and overall speed\u2014pushing users to upgrade to the latest model. To test this theory, I made a hypothesis in [***my previous post*** ](https://www.reddit.com/r/S24Ultra/comments/1iyp750/youre_forced_to_upgrade_arent_you/)and many of you wanted a detailed testing procedure. So, I conducted an experiment using three Galaxy S24 Ultra devices.\n\n**The Experiment: Same Device, Different Software Updates**\n\nI tested three Galaxy S24 Ultra units:\n\n* **Device 1:** Brand new, production date May 2024 (on May 24 patch).\n* **Device 2:** Brand new, production date May 2024 (on January 25 patch).\n* **Device 3:** My personal unit, production date March 2024 (on January 25 patch).\n\n**Testing Conditions: Real-World Use, Not Just Benchmarks**\n\nTo ensure fairness, I tested all three devices under identical conditions:\n\n* **Same cellular network** (same SIM provider and signal conditions).\n* **Cellular calls** for 1.5 hours each.\n* **Daily apps**: Instagram, YouTube video streaming, Netflix, Facebook, Reddit, and WhatsApp.\n* **Camera usage**: Photos and videos in various lighting conditions, including night mode and HDR.\n* **Gaming**: Subway Surfers and PUBG Mobile.\n* **AnTuTu Graphics Stress Test** to push GPU performance.\n* **Kept in room temperature** 27\u2103.\n* **Same settings**:\n   * **Adaptive battery:** Turned off.\n   * **No background activity**.\n   * **No bloatware**.\n   * **Same apps & versions, same sales region for all the three phones**.\n   * **Performance profile:** Standard mode.\n   * **Brightness level:** 70%.\n   * **Always-on display:** Turned on.\n\n# The Results: A Clear Performance Decline\n\n**Battery Performance Drops After Update**\n\nI flashed the **March 2024 security update** (S928BXXS1AXBN) onto devices 2 & 3 (which were on the January 25 patch before) to match them all on a similar state. Device 1 remained in the May 24 (S928BXXS2AXD5) patch as I couldn't flash the **March patch** on it, don\u2019t know why!\n\nThen, I monitored the **Screen-On Time (SoT):**\n\n* **Brand-new devices:** More than **7 hours 30 minutes** of SoT.\n* **My personal device:** Over **7 hours** of SoT. (Understandable, as the battery had degraded slightly.)\n\nAfter updating to the **January 2025 patch** (S928BXXS4AYA1) to all three devices:\n\n* SoT dropped to **6 hours 15-40 minutes**\u2014a noticeable decline.\n\nEven on standby mode, the battery drained faster than expected, making it difficult to last a full day. This decline suggests the update may have introduced new background processes or inefficiencies that weren't present in the older firmware, or its planned obsolescence??\n\n**Camera Performance Has Degraded**\n\nPhotos take longer to process, especially in night mode.\u00a0Longer processing time for HDR shots, making quick captures frustrating.\u00a0Increased noise and softer details, even in well-lit environments. Colors appear duller than before, losing their vibrancy and contrast. The brand-new camera experience is gone already.\n\n**Device Responsiveness Becomes Sluggish**\n\nAnimations and scrolling feel slower, making the device less fluid.\u00a0Apps take longer to open, especially heavier applications.\u00a0Multi-tasking has noticeable lag, even when switching between just two apps.\u00a0Read/write speeds dropped by 8-10%, affecting app performance.\n\n**Gaming Performance Shows Micro-Stutters**\n\nPUBG Mobile shows frequent frame drops, making gameplay less smooth.\u00a0Device heats up to 43\u2103 after extended play, whereas before, it remained cooler.\u00a0Frame rate consistency dropped by 7% over long gaming sessions, affecting responsiveness.\u00a0Longer loading times for high-performance apps, including games and video editors.\n\n# Interesting Fact: No Way Back!\n\nSamsung is way too smart\u2014once you update your phone, no matter how many times you go back and flash an older firmware, the performance and feel remain the same as the latest update. This suggests deep-level firmware optimizations that persist even after downgrading. I could identify this fact by comparing the two new devices side by side.\n\n**Samsung\u2019s Updates: Secretly Slowing Down Your Phone?**\n\nThis performance downgrade isn't an accident\u2014it seems intentional. Samsung wants the **Galaxy S25 Ultra** to feel like a gigantic upgrade over its predecessor. However, when the **S24 Ultra first launched, it was a beast.** It ran smoothly, had exceptional battery life, and delivered top-tier performance. Now, post-update, it\u2019s just another ordinary smartphone. If you hold an **S25 Ultra today**, you will feel the same punch you did when you bought the **S24 Ultra** last year. But the **updated S24 Ultra** is way behind the comparison So, what really changed in just **11 months**?\n\n**Samsung\u2019s Hidden Strategy: Why Do They Do This?**\n\nThe most logical explanation is **planned obsolescence**. While Apple has been caught doing this in the past, Samsung appears to be implementing similar tactics, but more subtly. Their seven-year software update promise sounds great, but if devices start underperforming within a year, how usable will they be by year three? Some might call this a conspiracy theory, but it raises an important question: **Should we trust manufacturers blindly when it comes to software updates?** Instead of silently nerfing performance, Samsung should be more transparent about how updates impact older devices.\n\nSo, if your phone runs smoothly, ask yourself\u2014do you really need that next security patch right now? While security updates are essential, they shouldn't come at the cost of usability. Before you hit \u201cupdate,\u201d think twice!\n\n**Disclaimer: The Challenge of Providing Hard Evidence**\n\nWhile my test results strongly suggest a performance decline, I must clarify that I cannot provide absolute proof or raw data logs. Due to technical constraints, including Samsung's encrypted bootloader and firmware restrictions, independent performance tracking is difficult. Additionally, Samsung does not allow full downgrades to previous firmware versions, making long-term comparative analysis nearly impossible. However, many users\u2014including myself\u2014have reported similar experiences, further supporting the idea that Samsung's updates may intentionally degrade performance.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i9q97vpj44me1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb2696f4ff47a12d22d4995414e6fa1ba2a47a01\n\n",

      "text": "Purchased S24U, Galaxy Buds 3 Pro and Galaxy Watch 7 last week. Switched from Apple Ecosystem to this.  Still use an iPad and a Mac but my iPhone 16 was to restricted. Was in the 'walled garden' for 3 years but after some time the Apple ecosystem features felt overrated. Using an iPhone when I could get my hands on the beast called S24 Ultra was too much for my gentle heart to bear. Don't even miss my Airpods and Apple Watch.\n\nIn my opinion, health tracking is better on Samsung since a unified view of all parameters is provided on Samsung Health app whereas on iPhone such parameters were scattered between Apple Health and Fitness App.\n\nSound quality is better on Galaxy Buds 3 pro though ANC is 8/10 on a scale where airpods prob2 anc would be 9/10.\n\nApart from the usual freedom that Android provides, Galaxy AI was a huge selling point. AI tools in Gallery are unparalleled compared to any such AI integration in the industry especially Apple.\n\nTL;DR Welcome Sam Fam.",

      "text": "**Is Samsung Deliberately Reducing Performance with Software Updates?**\n\nSamsung appears to be deliberately pushing software updates that negatively impact performance and battery life, potentially forcing users to upgrade to newer models. Having used the Galaxy S22 Ultra, S23 Ultra, and now the S24 Ultra, I have observed a consistent pattern: these devices initially excel in each segment. However, as they approach the one-year mark, software updates seem to gradually degrade their functionality rather than enhance it.\n\nTo test this, I compared two brand-new S24 Ultra devices and my own 11-month-old unit. The first device was running the March 2024 security patch, while the other two\u2014including mine\u2014were on the January 2025 patch. Surprisingly, the phone on the March 2024 update provided an additional hour of battery life and felt noticeably smoother than the other two. My 11-month-old device and the other new unit, both running the January 2025 update, delivered only **6.2 to 6.3 hours** of screen-on time, whereas the device on the older patch managed **7.3 hours**.\n\nThis raises an important question: How is it that a brand-new device and an 11-month-old device\u2014both on the same software version\u2014offer identical, reduced battery life, while another new unit on an earlier patch performs significantly better?\n\n*Apple* faced similar accusations of intentional performance throttling, but they implemented such changes only after 2\u20133 years. Samsung, on the other hand, appears to be accelerating this process, seemingly degrading device performance within just 8\u201310 months. This is unacceptable. Despite Samsung's promise of seven years of major software updates, such practices could render flagship devices barely usable after just three years, let alone seven.\n\nMost tech reviewers remain silent on this issue, but it is time for a transparent and detailed explanation. If Samsung continues down this path, my trust in their long-term software support will erode. Tell me yours.",

      "text": "At its semi annual Galaxy Unpacked event, Samsung has officially unveiled the three new devices in its S25 series lineup. The S25 series consists of the Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.\n\n*Disclaimer: Samsung invited me to attend the Galaxy S25 series launch event in San Jose. They covered my travel expenses but did not have any editorial input nor the ability to preview my content. Furthermore, this post was written with assistance from [/u/FragmentedChicken](https://www.reddit.com/user/FragmentedChicken/), who was also invited to the same event. If you\u2019d like to read this information with inline images, [click here to read the same post on Android Faithful.](https://www.androidfaithful.com/samsung-galaxy-s25/)*\n\n## Design\n\nThe overall design of the Galaxy S25 and S25+ is similar to last year\u2019s models, with an Armor Aluminum frame sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. \n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra design switches it up with a titanium frame this time with rounded corners, sandwiched by a layer of Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front, and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the back. The next generation Corning Gorilla Armor 2 offers improved drop protection and scratch resistance along with reduced reflections due to a glass-ceramic material and a new DX anti-reflection surface treatment. With the debut of the first generation of Corning Gorilla Armor on the S24 Ultra, Samsung says there have been 60% fewer screen-related repairs on the S24 Ultra compared to the S23 Ultra, so the hope is the second-generation will reduce that number even further.\n\nThe Galaxy S25 and S25+ come in a light blue \u201cIcyblue\u201d color, a light green \u201cMint\u201d color, a dark blue \u201cNavy\u201d color, and a gray \u201cSilver Shadow\u201d color. They are also available in a black \u201cBlueblack\u201d color, a gold \u201cPinkgold\u201d color, and a red \u201cCoralred\u201d color exclusively through Samsung. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, comes in a black \u201cTitanium Black\u201d color, a gray \u201cTitanium Gray\u201d color, a light blue \u201cTitanium Blue\u201d color, and a silver \u201cTitanium White Silver\u201d color. It\u2019s also available in a black \u201c Titanium Jetblack\u201d color, green \u201cJadegreen\u201d color, and a gold \u201cTitanium Pinkgold\u201d color exclusively through Samsung.\n\n## Display\n\nThe Galaxy S25 series phones share similar display characteristics. All three phones feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display which can reach a peak brightness of 2600 nits, and can adaptively refresh between 1 and 120Hz depending on the content. The base Galaxy S25 features a flat 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The Galaxy S25+ features a flat 6.7-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. Lastly, the Galaxy S25 Ultra features a flat 6.9-inch display with a resolution of 3120 x 1440 and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The display on the S25 Ultra is notably 0.1-inches larger thanks to slimmer bezels that are 15% smaller compared to the S24 Ultra.\n\nA new display feature called ProScaler allows for real-time AI image upscaling from 720p to 4K (only available on the S25+ and S25 Ultra).\n\nAll three devices have a Qualcomm-made ultrasonic fingerprint scanner underneath the display.\n\n## Cameras\n\nThe camera hardware on the Galaxy S25 series is also similar to last year\u2019s models, with the exception of the S25 Ultra which gains an upgraded rear-facing ultrawide sensor. The Galaxy S25 and S25+ share the same primary rear-facing camera: a 50MP wide-angle camera with OIS support, a f/1.8 aperture, and 1/1.56\u201d image sensor size. They also share the same secondary rear-facing camera: a 12MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f/2.2 aperture. Lastly, they also share the same tertiary rear-facing camera: a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom, OIS support, and a f/2.4 aperture. On the front, they share the same front facing camera: a 12MP selfie camera with a f/2.2 aperture.\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 200MP main camera with OIS support, a f/1.7 aperture, and 1/1.3\u201d image sensor size for the primary rear-facing camera. The secondary rear-facing camera is a 50MP ultra wide-angle camera with a 120\u00b0 field-of-view, and a f/1.9 aperture. Samsung says the new JN5 sensor in the ultra wide-angle camera can capture better macro photos as it reduces the need to crop-in as much. The detail is reportedly 4X greater compared to the S24 Ultra. The tertiary rear-facing camera is a 10MP telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS support. Finally, the quaternary rear-facing camera is a 50MP periscopic telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom and OIS support. On the front, the selfie camera is a 12MP shooter with a f/2.2 aperture.\n\nWhile there aren\u2019t many hardware-related camera changes, Samsung made a lot of improvements to the camera software which include:\n\n* 10-bit HDR video recording which increases dynamic range by 4X versus 8-bit.\n* Nightography video mode that produces sharper and clearer footage with less noise.\n    * This is achieved with Spatio-Temporal Filter (STF) support in the ISP which analyzes movement and time to reduce noise. It also distinguishes between moving and stationary objects to improve image quality.\n* The STF system also results in better portrait photography.\n* Reportedly improved shutter speed/lag.\n* LOG video recording via Galaxy Log in Pro Video Mode with exclusive LUTS for precision control in color and lighting.\n* Virtual aperture for AI depth of field and brightness adjustments via the Expert RAW app.\n\n## The S25 series under the hood\n\nThe Galaxy S25 series is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset. Unlike previous Snapdragon for Galaxy chipsets that only featured higher clockspeeds, Samsung says this chipset is completely custom which allows for better camera integration as well as overall performance. Samsung didn\u2019t fully elaborate on what exactly is completely custom about this chipset, though.\n\nTheir press release does mention that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy includes some Galaxy IP in the form of a mobile Digital Natural Image engine which allows for better display power efficiency. Otherwise, the CPU, GPU, and NPU in the chipset have been overclocked, resulting in a 37%, 30%, and 40% boost in performance, respectively. In the 3DMark Solar Bay benchmark for ray-tracing, the S25 series outperforms the S24 series by 40%. \n\nThe heat dissipation system for the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy has improved through the use of a 15% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 and S25+, and a 40% larger vapor chamber in the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to the previous generation. Additionally, a new tailored thermal interface material that engulfs the chipset allows for greater thermal efficiency.\n\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is paired with 12GB of RAM across the board for the S25 series. That\u2019s up from 8GB of RAM for the base S25 phone. There is no 16GB RAM option, at least not in North America.\n\nStorage wise, the Galaxy S25 starts at 128GB and goes up to 256GB, whereas the S25+ and S25 Ultra are offered in 256GB or 512GB options. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also comes in a 1TB storage option. \n\nConnectivity wise, Qualcomm told me the Galaxy S25 series are the first phones to support Snapdragon Satellite which allows for messaging via narrowband non-terrestrial (NTN) networks. They also said the entire Galaxy S25 series lineup comes equipped with the company\u2019s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity subsystem, meaning every device in the lineup supports WiFi 7. That\u2019s an improvement from the previous generation where only the Ultra supported WiFi 7. \n\nAll three devices also support Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast as well as eSIM. In addition, the Galaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also support ultra-wideband (UWB) which can be used for digital car keys as well as precision locating of Samsung SmartTags. Sadly, the base Galaxy S25 does not support UWB. \n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that the S Pen in the Galaxy S25 Ultra no longer supports Bluetooth gestures (Air actions). What\u2019s more is that Bluetooth gestures on the S25 Ultra will reportedly not work with Bluetooth enabled S Pens including the S Pen Pro.\n\n## Battery & charging\n\nThe battery capacity and charging speeds for the Galaxy S25 series are the same as the previous generation. The base Galaxy S25 has a 4000mAh battery and 25W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25+ has a 4900mAh battery with faster 45W wired charging support. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5000mAh battery and also 45W wired charging support. \n\nAll three phones in the Galaxy S25 series support 15W wireless charging but sadly lack Qi2 magnetic charging support. Despite the lack of Qi2 support, Samsung has worked with \u201cMade for Galaxy\u201d partners like Spigen to certify third-party magnetic cases that align perfectly with the charging coils in the Galaxy S25 series phones.\n\n## One UI 7.0, now with even more Galaxy AI features\n\nThe stable version of One UI 7.0 debuts on the Galaxy S25 series with an additional suite of Galaxy AI features along with improvements to existing Galaxy AI features. Samsung says Galaxy AI features are free until the end of 2025, which is the same thing they said during the launch of the S24 series. \n\nThe new Galaxy AI features include:\n\n* Now Brief  \n    * Offers contextual information depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening) in the form of a widget on the home screen.  \n* Now Bar  \n    * Provides the same information from the Now Brief but on the lock screen. Also cycles through various Samsung apps like the Clock and supports a few Google smart space cards like Google Maps for navigation, sports updates from teams you follow on Google, and more.  \n* AI search in Samsung Gallery  \n    * Enables searching through photos with voice input.\n    * Allows for the use of natural language (\u201cFind photos from my trip to Italy\u201d).  \n* Personalized Data Engine  \n    * This is a feature that analyzes your habits to provide personalized recommendations. For example, this feature can offer suggested Routines you should turn on. If you usually turn dark mode on at night and off in the morning, the phone will prompt for the creation of a new Routine to toggle dark mode depending on the time of day.  \n    * Features like Now Brief, Now Bar, and AI search in Samsung Gallery are also powered by the Personalized Data Engine.  \n    * This feature works on-device and only with Samsung apps, and the data can be transferred to a new Samsung device via Smart Switch.  \n* Audio eraser  \n    * Recognizes audio from videos and separates them into categories including voices, crowds, wind, music, nature, and general noise.\n    * Runs on-device.\n    * Not developed in collaboration with Google.\n* AI settings search  \n    * Makes it easy to find relevant settings. Simply open the Settings app, tap the search bar, then hit the mic icon and tell the assistant what you\u2019d like to change. \n    * Eg. if you say \u201cmake my text more visible\u201d you\u2019ll see a list of relevant text/accessibility options appear.  \n\nThe improvements to existing Galaxy AI features include:\n\n* AI Select  \n    * Smart Select has seemingly been renamed to AI Select.  \n    * Provides relevant actions depending on the content on the screen. For example, if a video is selected, AI Select will suggest making a GIF. If an image is selected, AI Select will suggest editing with Generative edit.\n* Sketch to Image  \n    * Now multimodal with text and voice input.  \n* Object eraser  \n    * Upgraded AI model which can erase objects, reflections, and shadows faster with greater accuracy.  \n* Generative edit  \n    * In-and-out painting is more accurate.  \n    * Now runs on-device.  \n* Portrait Studio  \n    * You can now create personalized avatars with more true-to-life facial expressions.  \n    * New analog style filters are available.  \nOutside of Galaxy AI features, there are also new software features which include:\n* Gemini integration  \n    * You can now long press the side key/power button to invoke Google Gemini. The Gemini overlay now has a new UI (you may have seen it already).  \n    * Gemini now also supports cross-app interactions. \n    * Gemini Live now supports live chatting about files/images/YouTube videos, and more.  \n    * Gemini now has extensions for Samsung Notes, Samsung Calendar, Samsung Clock, and Samsung Reminder.  \n* Storage Share with Galaxy Book PCs  \n* Camera Share with Galaxy Book PCs  \n\nSamsung has promised 7 OS updates and 7 years of security updates for the Galaxy S25 series.
